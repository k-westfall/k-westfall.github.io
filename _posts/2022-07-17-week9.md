Unfortunately, we did not feel the local logs were comparable to the logs sent by the data forwarders. Andy and I both felt it best to re-run the week of experiments. With the lab in agreement of our assessment, we planned another 5 day data collection period.

# Current Tasks
* Re-run entire experiment.
