title: Week 4
---
Andy and I shared updates on succesful execution of all attacks. Next, we will collect logs from our victim machines using several different logging frameworks. We also plan to review a commercial EDR system to determine whether it could provide a baseline for assessing the performance of our approaches to detecting attacks via logs.

# Current Tasks
* Evaluate Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)[[1]][ref1] to determine which features we should use for our experiment
* Begin equipping victim systems with logging frameworks (SysMon, Event Log, ETW, commercial EDR, Windows Security Auditing)

# Journal
Following the successful completion of attack execution, Andy and I moved onto new tasks. Andy led the effort of collecting EDR rules while I explored features of Windows Event Tracing to determine the best setup for our experiment.
