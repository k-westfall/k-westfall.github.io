title: Week 7 & Week 8

Andy and I presented the successful execution of the data collection period. Upon further examination, the data forwarders required to send details of our experiment to AWS S3 were not turned on, resulting in zero data from that vantage point.


# Current Tasks
* Review EDR log data stored on endpoints, compare to see if local data is sufficient to replace what would have been sent by the data forwarders.
* Organize all other data for initial evaluation by lab members.

# Journal
The entire experiment was executed almost flawlessly, so the discovery of missing data forwarders was a major dissapointment. Our main task this week was to attempt to salvage the lost data. We found that there are some local logs stored on the endpoints from the EDR tool. To compare the EDR logs stored on endpoints with the data sent by data forwarding, we executed a single attack with the data forwarders on.
