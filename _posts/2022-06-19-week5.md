title: Week 5
---
We've successfully installed all logging frameworks that will be utilized in our experiment (Event Tracing for Windows, Sysmon, a commercial Endpoint Detection and Response system, Firefox logs, and wireshark DNS logs).

# Current Tasks
* Develop full experiment timeline, outlining the length of each stage (benign and attack), the specific events and activites to be carried out in each stage, plans for coordinating efforts between phishing and website poisoning attacks, and specific time windows that each attack scenario will be executed.
* Resolve any remaining issues regarding attack execution, especially addressing the complexity of networking through our VMs.

# Journal
Most of our time this week was spent working out bugs in the attack scenarios. Other lingering issues revolve around networking problems. We plan to have one attacker and one dedicated "host 1" user, creating some setup challenges in getting our VMs to interact via IP on the university's network.
