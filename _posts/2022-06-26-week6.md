title: Week 6

This week we finalized our data collection plan and worked with the lab to resolve any remaining issues.

# Current Tasks
* Determine best path for attacks that are blocked by our EDR tool.
* Execute Attacks!

# Journal
The only remaining issue was the best way to allow attacks through the EDR tool. Currently, some attack scenarios are immediately detected resulting in the EDR quarantining the endpoint. We want to ensure the system is still generating alert and watchlist hits without blocking the full execution of the attack scenario, including manual bypass of the endpoint. This is an easy fix, but required agreement by the group that our logs are representing real-user data.

Attack week kicked off on Monday, starting the four day benign period with Andy and I working on our Windows 7 VMs approximately 8 hours per day. On Friday morning we launched "Attack Day", dedicating 45 minute windows to benign system use mixed with malicious scenarios. All attacks went as planned.
