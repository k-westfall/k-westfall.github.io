title: Week 3

This week is focused on continuing resolving issues, working toward the reproduction of documented attack scenarios.

# Current Tasks
* Continue exploration of running ATLAS attack scenarios
* Install commercial EDR sensors on our virtual endpoints to monitor activity of victim machines [[1]][ref1]
* Set up a Kali Linux virtual machine to serve as the malicious actor

# Journal
We contacted the author of ATLAS after encountering issues accessing the attack VM they supplied. We were unable to recieve a new copy of this machine, so the first task this week invoved the setup of a new attack machine.

While continuing our attempt of reproduction, we came across two main issues: 
1. We'll need access to a domain for creating malicious activity
2. We were unable to compile the payload executable supplied by the author

Ultimately we resolved the payload executable issue which was mainly caused by imcompatiable versions of packages.
