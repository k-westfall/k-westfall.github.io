Ending our final week of the DREAM program, we successfully collected all data as planned in our second running of the experiment.

# Current Tasks
* Organize collected data
* Develop parsers to format our logs in a way useful for certain systems

# Journal
The execution of our second run was not as smooth as the first, but we managed to complete and collect all data specified in our plan. With our DREAM program coming to an end, Andy and I now plan to continue our work as Research Assistants in the Secure and Transparent Systems Lab this upcoming Fall semester. I look forward to the opportunity to learn more about intrusion detection research and to apply the dataset generated this summer to various systems. Though there were ups and downs throughout the experience, I enjoyed it greatly and appreciate all of the insights gained from the collaboration opportunites with this research group.
