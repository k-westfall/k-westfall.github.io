## About Me

I'm a MCS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a recent graduate of UIUC's iCAN program. Prior to joining the University of Illinois, I worked as an art educator and cross country coach. I received my bachelors from McMurry University in 2017, majoring in art education with a minor in curriculum and instruction. 

## About My Advisor

Advisor info goes here.

[Adam Bates](https://adambates.org/) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He leads [The Secure and Transparent Systems Laboratory](https://sts.cs.illinois.edu/), a research group interested in detecting, investigating, and preventing intrusions in various computing environments. He is best known for his work in the area of data provenance, particularly the construction of secure provenance-aware systems.

## About My Project

My summer research is completed in partnership with [Andy Riddle](https://rriddle2.github.io/), another DREAM fellow. Our work primarily focuses on intrusion detection systems leveraging host data for detecting and investigating attacks. We examine existing systems for evaluating security logs and the limitations of the training and testing data available to these systems. Our main contribution is the introduction of an improved system log dataset capturing events from Microsoft Windows Security Auditing, Microsoft SysMon, Carbon Black Cloud Endpoint Detection and Response System, Firefox application system logging, and DNS logging data from Wireshark. Our dataset spans multiple days of benign system use and includes an attack phase incorporating ten different advanced attacks in both single host and multiple host configurations. Analysis of our dataset highlights the need for more effective systems to provide support to security analysts in prioritizing which alerts require further investigation.
